# The guards on perch's agent skills — one copy, run from two places.
#
# Every failure here is INVISIBLE at runtime. A skill whose frontmatter is
# missing, unterminated, or whose `name:` disagrees with the directory it
# installs into is installed fine, listed fine, and never loaded —
# indistinguishable, from a user's side, from the agent not knowing perch
# exists. So it has to be a build failure, and it has to fire in CI.
#
# Which is why this is a script and not a `runCommand` body: perch's CI builds
# Xcode targets with no Nix at all, so guards living only in nix/skill.nix would
# run on a developer's machine and nowhere else. `nix/skill.nix` calls this and
# `.github/workflows/build.yml` calls it directly.
#
# It DISCOVERS the skills rather than being handed a list, and that is the
# point: a hardcoded list here plus a second one in nix/skill.nix plus a third
# in the workflow is three places to forget a new skill.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-skills.sh <ai-dir> <tool-name>
#
#   <ai-dir>/SKILL.md        → checked as <tool-name>   (the tool's own skill)
#   <ai-dir>/*/SKILL.md      → checked as its directory name
